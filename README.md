Programs to Send Weather Alerts

This is a set of programs to send email alerts with projected forecast information.

The programs are written in Python 3.
The SAMPLEconfigInfo file shows you an outline and has places for you to fill in your own details. The program WILL NOT run without changing that file.

Currently, the only weather service that this program pulls from is Open Weather Map. You will need the API key from them to make the program work. I used the free 5-day forecast API in building this program. Future updates will include other weather services for a more comprehensive forecast.
